> 1 Oct 2023 - 18 Jan 2024 (14 Weeks)

List of subjects learned : _

## SECI1013 - DISCRETE STRUCTURE
This course introduces students to the principles and applications of discrete structure in the
field of computer science. The topics that are covered in this course are set theory, proof
techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees
and finite automata. At the end of the course, the students should be able to use set theory,
relations and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems
using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real world
problems and use deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic
devices and problems.

## SECJ1013 - PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE I
As a fundamental subject, this course equips the students with theory and practice on
problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. Students are required to
develop programs using C++ programming language, in order to solve simple to moderate
problems. The course covers the following: pre-processor directives, constants and
variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection
and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single and two-dimensional arrays, file
operations, pointers, and structured data types.

## SECR1013 - DIGITAL LOGIC
Digital electronics is the foundation of all microprocessor-based systems found in computers,
robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. This course introduces the students to
digital electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts, components,
and tools. Students will get up-to-date coverage of digital fundamentals-from basic concepts
to programmable logic devices. Laboratory experiments provide hands-on experience with
the simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the classroom.

## [SECP1513](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/tree/main/SECP1513-Technology%26Information%20System) - TECHNOLOGY & INFORMATION SYSTEM
As a primer subject, this course will introduce students to information systems and
technology (IS/IT) and the emerging trends of IS/IT, as well as its uses in daily life both at
home and at work. Various aspects of IS/IT encompassing hardware, software, network,
communications, internet, multimedia, graphics, systems applications, 4IR, cloud computing
and data analytics will be introduced. Students will be equipped with basic skills in setting up
and handling cloud server via practical work in the virtual guided lab, which shall comprise a
major part of the study. At the end of the course, student should be able to distinguish basic
IS/IT component and applications.
