## [DISCRETE STRUCTURE üìè](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/tree/main/SECI1013-Discrete%20Structure)
This course teaches students the fundamental concepts and practical use of discrete structures in computer science. It covers topics such as set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees, and finite automata. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in applying set theory, relations, and functions to solve computer science problems. They will also be able to analyze problems using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees to real-world scenarios, and use deterministic finite automata to model electronic devices and problems.

## [PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE I üñ•Ô∏è](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/tree/main/SECJ1013-Programming%20Technique%20I)
This course provides students with essential knowledge and hands-on experience in problem-solving through a structured approach. Students use the C++ programming language to create programs addressing simple to moderate problems. The topics covered include pre-processor directives, constants, variables, data types, input/output statements, control structures (sequential, selection, and loop), built-in and user-defined functions, single and two-dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types.

## [DIGITAL LOGIC üí°](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/tree/main/SECR1013-Digital%20Logic)
Digital electronics forms the basis of microprocessor-driven systems in computers, robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. This course offers students an introduction to digital electronics, covering essential concepts, components, and tools. It provides a comprehensive understanding of digital fundamentals, from basic ideas to programmable logic devices. Hands-on experience is gained through laboratory experiments using simulator software, real devices, and circuits studied in the classroom.

## [TECHNOLOGY & INFORMATION SYSTEM üíæ](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/tree/main/SECP1513-Technology%26Information%20System) 
This course serves as an introduction to information systems and technology (IS/IT), along with current trends and their everyday applications at home and work. It covers various aspects of IS/IT, including hardware, software, networks, communications, internet, multimedia, graphics, systems applications, 4IR, cloud computing, and data analytics. Students will gain basic skills in setting up and managing cloud servers through practical work in virtual guided labs, a significant part of the course. By the end, students should be able to identify basic IS/IT components and applications.

## [INTEGRITY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RSPfpgAv_-PljcVyb5qa1onz8TXThkBU)
This course also emphasizes the importance of value systems and ethics, which include aspects of human relationships and managing/appreciating diversity. In addition, this course also emphasizes holistic solutions to current issues, transformation and innovation, philosophy of science and technology based on values, integrity and self-identity towards achieving the goal of producing excellent graduates in terms of physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual .

## [ENGLISH COMMUNICATION SKILLS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bcev5NR6I2M4pY-j1HhIDH6YN0QIf_AA)
This English course is designed to reinforce and enhance students‚Äô existing English Language skills to enable them to communicate better in their current surrounding (higher education setting). Through guided and independent learning activities, students will develop their skills in reading, listening, writing as well as speaking. At the end of the course, students should be able to recognise relevant information in texts on topics of interest. Students should also be able to write on familiar topics. Additionally, this course will provide students with opportunities to enhance their listening and speaking skills.
