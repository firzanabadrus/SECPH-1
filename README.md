## SECI1013 - DISCRETE STRUCTUREüìè
This course teaches students the fundamental concepts and practical use of discrete structures in computer science. It covers topics such as set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees, and finite automata. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in applying set theory, relations, and functions to solve computer science problems. They will also be able to analyze problems using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees to real-world scenarios, and use deterministic finite automata to model electronic devices and problems.

## SECJ1013 - PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE Iüñ•Ô∏è
This course provides students with essential knowledge and hands-on experience in problem-solving through a structured approach. Students use the C++ programming language to create programs addressing simple to moderate problems. The topics covered include pre-processor directives, constants, variables, data types, input/output statements, control structures (sequential, selection, and loop), built-in and user-defined functions, single and two-dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types.

## SECR1013 - DIGITAL LOGICüí°
Digital electronics forms the basis of microprocessor-driven systems in computers, robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. This course offers students an introduction to digital electronics, covering essential concepts, components, and tools. It provides a comprehensive understanding of digital fundamentals, from basic ideas to programmable logic devices. Hands-on experience is gained through laboratory experiments using simulator software, real devices, and circuits studied in the classroom.

## [SECP1513](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/tree/main/SECP1513-Technology%26Information%20System) - TECHNOLOGY & INFORMATION SYSTEMüíæ
This course serves as an introduction to information systems and technology (IS/IT), along with current trends and their everyday applications at home and work. It covers various aspects of IS/IT, including hardware, software, networks, communications, internet, multimedia, graphics, systems applications, 4IR, cloud computing, and data analytics. Students will gain basic skills in setting up and managing cloud servers through practical work in virtual guided labs, a significant part of the course. By the end, students should be able to identify basic IS/IT components and applications.
