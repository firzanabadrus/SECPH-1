* ### Assignment
  Assignment 1 : [Poster](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/blob/main/SECP1513-Technology%26Information%20System/ASSIGNMENT/Career%20Development%20Poster.pdf)
  > I explored the route of starting a computer science career in this assignment, with the goal of becoming a data scientist. I conducted a thorough investigation to determine what was necessary to succeed in this position. I also learned how to create a curriculum vitae (CV), or resume, that is successful for job applications. As I thought back on my own growth, I saw how important it is to build soft skills, especially in critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. One important takeaway from what I found is the value of gaining a variety of experiences via industrial training, as this helps to extend my viewpoint.

  > In this assignment, I gained so much experience visiting the most  technological industries which are Petronas and Huawei. I discovered that there are so many technologies that can be developed even by a year. That means we need to always keep updating our knowledge in all of the technologies in order to show our concern about the IT field.

  > In this assignment, I learned about how UTM Digital works in our university as a digital university driver. There were  so many departments that provided the officers with so many facilities so that they could do their work comfortably. They also have the special department for student’s enquiries which is UTM Digital Care. Students can go there if they have any problem with their UTM apps or the student portal.

  > In this assignment, I learned how the system development process works in the computer field. I also learned the history of the emerging system development life cycle, from the Waterfall model to the latest development. I gained knowledge about the technologies and tools used in Credence’s system development. For example, Tableau and Power BI. Lastly, skills in programming languages are highlighted in this task, which is that we need to be experts in any programming language like Java and Python.
