# PC ASSEMBLE
**22/11/2023**

The computer system, consisting of various components like the PC case, cables, power supply, RAM, hard disc, and CPU fan, relies on the Central Processing Unit (CPU) as its main brain. To disassemble and reassemble the computer system, follow these steps: switch off the computer, open the casing, disconnect all cables inside, unplug the power supply, uninstall the random access memory (RAM), disconnect the hard disc drive, and finally, unplug the CPU fan. This process allows for maintenance or upgrades while ensuring proper handling of the internal components.

**Reflection**
> Disassembling and reassembling a PC was a valuable hands-on experience. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world situations and deepen my knowledge of computer hardware. Recognising the significance of each component, from the PC case to the CPU fan, emphasized the importance of precision and safety protocols. This practical exercise bridged the gap between theory and application, providing insight crucial for anyone interested in pursuing a career in computer science, particularly in hardware or system administration.

> To enhance my hands-on experience of disassembling and reassembling a PC, I need to improve my documentation skills by recording detailed steps and identifying solutions. In addition, I intend to broaden my knowledge of diagnostic tools for hardware testing and explore more advanced components. Experimenting with different hardware configurations will also further enrich my understanding of computer systems.
