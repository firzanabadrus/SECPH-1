In our project, we need to develop the recently developed project, which only had a 2-bit up/down counter, could only reach 4 levels, and used a D flip flop. So, we managed to upgrade the old one and discuss what we should have added and improved in our project. We upgraded the 8-story elevator system with a new electronic controller system. We added a 3-bit bidirectional saturated counter, along with combinational and sequential circuit components. We also make this elevator have strong security with the addition of a visitor's card detector, a 4-digit password system, and an open/close door indicator. For sure, our elevator controller system was user-friendly.
