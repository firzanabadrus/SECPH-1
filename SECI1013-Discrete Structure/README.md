# DISCRETE STRUCTURE

Contents : _ 

- Chapter 1 : **Set Theory & Logic**
    - 1.1 SET AND SUBSET
    - 1.2 OPERATION ON SET
    - 1.3 FUNDAMENTAL AND ELEMENTS OF LOGIC
    - 1.4 QUANTIFIERS AND PROOF TECHNIQUE
 
> [ASSIGNMENT 1]( )
> This assignment was based on chapter 1 in discrete structure. We need to do this assignment in groups of 3 and we did all the questions then discuss together which was the best answer for the final submission.

- Chapter 2 : **Relations & Functions**
    - 2.1 RELATIONS
    - 2.2 FUNCTIONS
    - 2.3 RECURRENCE AND RECURSIVE ALGORITHMS

> [ASSIGMENT 2](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/blob/main/SECI1013-Discrete%20Structure/Assignment%202.pdf)
> This assignment was based on chapter 2 which is relations and functions. We need to do this assignment in groups of 3 and we decided to divide the task fairly. Then, we discussed before sending the final assessment.

- Chapter 3 : **Counting Method & Probability**
    - 3.1 COUNTING METHOD
    - 3.2 PERMUTATION
    - 3.3 COMBINATION
    - 3.4 PIGEONHOLE PRINCIPLE
    - 3.5 PROBABILITY
 
> [ASSIGNMENT 3](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/blob/main/SECI1013-Discrete%20Structure/Assignment%203.pdf)
> This assignment was based on subtopic 3.4 pigeonhole principle, 3.5 probability and 4.1 graph definition. We need to do this assignment in groups of 3 and we divided the task fairly. We discussed after completing each part before sending it.

- Chapter 4 : **Graph Theory**
    - 4.1 GRAPH DEFINITION AND NOTATIONS
    - 4.2 REPRESENTATION OF GRAPHS
    - 4.3 ISOMORPHISM OF GRAPHS
    - 4.4 PATH AND CYCLES
    - 4.5 EULER CYCLES
    - 4.6 HAMILTONIAN CYCLES
    - 4.7 DJIKSTRA' SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHM
    - 4.8 TREES

> [ASSIGNMENT 4](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-1/blob/main/SECI1013-Discrete%20Structure/Assignment%204.pdf)
> This assignment was based on subtopic 4.3 to 4.8 in Graph Theory. We need to do this assignment in groups of 3 and we do the task fairly. Then, we discussed together for make sure there were no errors.

- Chapter 5 : **Finite Automata**
    - 5.1 DETERMINISTIC FINITE AUTOMATA (DFA)
    - 5.2 FINITE STATE MACHINES (FSM)
